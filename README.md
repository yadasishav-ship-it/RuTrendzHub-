# Rubi Trendz Hub — Starter Website

This repository contains a starter full-stack scaffold for Rubi Trendz Hub (saree shop). It implements:

- WhatsApp notifications to other shops (via Twilio) when a project is created.
- Project lifecycle: open -> delivered -> closed.
- Monthly sales report of sales made to other shopkeepers and project history.

Tech stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React (Vite or Create React App compatible)
- WhatsApp: Twilio WhatsApp API (example integration)
